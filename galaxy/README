IMPORTANT NOTES
- These workflows were ment to test Galaxy for making RNA-Seq workflows
- When choosing to run the workflow, the steps might not appear in the correct order in the overview
- These workflows all expect dataset collections as input ; not all tools can work with these types of input


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_genmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference genome and subsequently perform differential expression analysis
- The DESeq2 tool at minimum requires a factor with two levels to be set ; a factor 'condition' with the levels: 'control' and 'treated' for example.


Tools that require input:
- [Replicates Condition A]: Dataset collection of replicate paired end read data for the first condition in fastq or fastq.gz format
- [Replicates Condition B]: Dataset collection of replicate paired end read data for the second condition in fastq or fastq.gz format
- [Reference genome]: Reference genome sequence in FASTA format
- [Reference genome annotation]: Reference genome annotation file in GTF format



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_genmap_multi
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map many paired end read datasets to a reference genome


Tools that require input
- [FastQ paired dataset collection]: Dataset collection of paired end read data fastq or fastq.gz format
- [Reference genome]: Reference genome sequence in FASTA format
- [Reference genome annotation]: Reference genome annotation file in GTF format



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_trmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference transcriptome and subsequently perform differential expression analysis
- The DESeq2 tool at minimum requires a factor with two levels to be set; a factor 'condition' with the levels: 'control' and 'treated' for example.


Tools that require input
- [Replicates Condition A]: Dataset collection of replicate paired end read data for the first condition in fastq or fastq.gz format
- [Replicates Condition B]: Dataset collection of replicate paired end read data for the second condition in fastq or fastq.gz format
- [Reference transcriptome]: Reference transcriptome sequences in FASTA format.
- [Transcript-to-Gene]: A two column file with transcript identifiers in the first and gene identifiers (to which the transcript belongs to) in the second

++A few questions and answers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Q: Can these workflows be run without modification?
A: Yes, however, users may want to rename output files tools creates.

Q: I have newer/older tool versions, can the workflow still be run?
A: Generally workflows can be run with different tool versions, but results may differ. If the same tool is from a different repository, workflows might
	not work properly.

Q: Why do the workflows use dataset collections as input?
A: Dataset collections were chosen as they allow for a different numer of replicate datasets to be used without having to change the workflow. 

Q: What is the transcript to gene table that the transcriptome differential expression analysis workflow (wf_trmap_dea) requires?
A: The DESeq2 tool used for differential expression analysis in this workflow reports differential expression per gene. The transcript to gene table
	consists of two columns. The first contains transcript identifiers, the second contains gene identifiers.
