# RNA-seqFlow
KNIME, Galaxy and CLC RNA-Seq workflows 
Computational analysis of RNA-seq data is a common task in data-driven biology and medicine but, unfortunately, often performed manually or using ad hoc scripts. To ensure reproducibility and knowledge sharing, workflow management tools (WMTs) can be used to develop reusable computational pipelines (workflows). For our analysis, we chose Galaxy as a free open source WMT, KNIME as an intermediate between free and commercial with partially open source and CLC Bio as a commercial tool with closed source.
