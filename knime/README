IMPORTANT NOTES
- These workflows were ment to test KNIME for making RNA-Seq analysis worfklows.
- These workflows use the KNIME4NGS package to function. To install KNIME4NGS to Knime see ... or see the cookbook (will be added later).

++wf_trmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference transcriptome.
- As is, the workflow expects paired end read data to be as two seperate files (i.e.: reads_1.fastq, reads_2.fastq)


Nodes to configure prior to running (!=must , *=optional):
! [FileLoader]: Provide tab separated file containing paths to read data in fastq or fastq.gz format
* [RawReadManipulator]: 
! [Bowtie2]: Provide reference transcriptome ; set appropriate values for mapping parameters
! [CSV Reader]: Provide tab separated file containing the deseq annotation/design
* [DESeq]: Set appropriate parameters
! [CSV Writer]: Provide path to a file to write deseq results to (if file doesn't exist it will be created)

++wf_genmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference


Nodes to configure prior to running (!=must , *=optional)
! [FileLoader]: 
* [RawReadManipulator]
! [BWA]: Provide reference genome ; set appropriate values for mapping parameters
! [FeatureCounts]: Provide genome annotation file in GTF format, set output folder (required)
! [FeatureCountsMerger]:
! [CSV Reader]:
* [DESeq]:
! [CSV Writer]: Provide path to a file to write deseq results to (if file doesn't exist it will be created)
