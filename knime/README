IMPORTANT NOTES:
- These workflows were ment to test KNIME for making RNA-Seq analysis worfklows.
- These workflows use the KNIME4NGS package to function. To install KNIME4NGS to Knime see ... or see the cookbook (will be added later).
- The coloured boxes in each workflow display the workload: green=light and quick, yellow=moderate, red=heavy and long


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_genmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference genome and subsequently perform differential expression analysis

Nodes to configure prior to running (!=must , *=optional)
! [FileLoader]: Provide tab separated file containing paths to read data in fastq or fastq.gz format
* [FastQC]
* [RawReadManipulator]
* [FastQC]
! [BWA]: Provide reference genome ; set appropriate values for mapping parameters
! [FeatureCounts]: Provide genome annotation file in GTF format, set output folder (required)
! [FeatureCountsMerger]: Provide location and name for output file that will contain the merged count tables ()
! [CSV Reader]: Provide tab separated file containing the deseq annotation/design
* [DESeq]
! [CSV Writer]: Provide path to a file to write deseq results to (if file doesn't exist it will be created)



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_genmap_multi
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map and quantify many paired read datasets to a reference genome

Nodes to configure prior to running (!=must, *=optional)
! [FileLoader]: Provide tab separated file containing paths to read data in fastq or fastq.gz format
* [FastQC]
* [RawReadManipulator]
* [FastQC]
! [BWA]: Provide reference genome
! [FeatureCounts]: Provide genome annotation file in GTF format, set output folder (required)



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_trmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference transcriptome and subsequently perform differential expression analysis
- As is, the workflow expects paired end read data to be as two seperate files (i.e.: reads_1.fastq, reads_2.fastq)

Nodes to configure prior to running (!=must , *=optional):
! [FileLoader]: Provide tab separated file containing paths to read data in fastq or fastq.gz format
* [FastQC]
* [RawReadManipulator]
* [FastQC]
! [Bowtie2]: Provide reference transcriptome
! [CSV Reader]: Provide tab separated file containing the deseq annotation/design
* [DESeq]: Set appropriate parameters
! [CSV Writer]: Provide path to a file to write deseq results to (if file doesn't exist it will be created)

+ A few questions and answers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Q: What type of sequencing data do the workflows expect as input?
A: The workflows expect paired end (Illumina) read data with forward and reverse reads in separate fastq or fastq.gz files

Q: Any advice on the folder structure for the input and output data?
A: As the output locations cannot be changed for most nodes, it might be helpful to keep each paired end read data in a separate folder as output from
	most processing nodes will be saved in the same folder.

Q: What if I want to use different tools than those in the workflow?
A: For some workflow steps such as read mapping, multiple tools are available (bowtie2, STAR, Razer, segemehl, ...) whereas for other steps might be
	very few tools available. You therefore might need to make nodes for those tools or use other nodes such as code snippet nodes or the external tool
	node.

Q: Are there any things to keep in mind?
A: Nodes from the KNIME4NGS package require the binaries of tools (bowtie2, STAR, FeatureCounts, etc) to be present as a binary. It is best to
	configure the KNIME4NGS package within KNIME so the nodes will always know where the required binaries are.
