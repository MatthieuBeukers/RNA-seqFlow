IMPORTANT NOTES
- These workflows were meant to test CLC for making RNA-Seq workflows
- This project used and ran the non installer versions of the workflows (workflows ending in .clc) from the workflow editor
- The multi mapping workflows 'wf_genmap_multi' and 'wf_trmap_multi' are meant to be run in batch mode
- Users may want to configure the output nodes of a workflow to give output files a convenient name

++Workflow: wf_genmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference genome and subsequently perform differential expression analysis

Input nodes required to configure
- [R1CA]: First replicate paired end read data for the first condition
- [R2CA]: Second replicate paired end read data for the first condition
- [R1CB]: First replicate paired end read data for the second condition
- [R2CB]: Second replicate paired end read data for the second condition
- [Reference transcriptome]: Reference genome sequence in FASTA format (please see Q&A down below)
- [Gene Track]: Gene track created from the GTF genome annotation file
- [mRNA Track]: mRNA track created from the GTF genome annotation file



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_genmap_multi
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map many paired end read datasets to a reference genome

Input node required to configure
- [Genome Reference]: Reference genome sequence in FASTA format (please see Q&A down below)
- [Gene Track File]: Gene track created from the GTF genome annotation file
- [mRNA Track File]: mRNA track created from the GTF genome annotation file



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_trmap_dea
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map paired end read data to a reference transcriptome and subsequently perform differential expression analysis


Input nodes required to configure
- [R1CA]: First replicate paired end read data for the first condition
- [R2CA]: Second replicate paired end read data for the first condition

- [R2CB]: Second replicate paired end read data for the second condition
- [Reference transcriptome]: Reference transcriptome sequences in FASTA format



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++Workflow: wf_trmap_multi
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- This workflow can be used to map many paired end read datasets to a reference transcriptome

Input node required to configure
- [Transcriptome Reference]: Reference genome sequence in FASTA format (please see Q&A down below)

++A few questions and answers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Q: What is the way to run the workflows?
A: These workflows were ment to be run from the workflow editor, not as installed tools. So opening the .clc workflow file in the editor and running
	them from there would be the best method.

Q: How do I get the required Gene and mRNA tracks?
A: Gene and mRNA tracks can be obtained in CLC from the GTF file.

Q: The input for the reference genome in genome differential expression workflow (wf_genmap_dea) is called 'Reference transcriptome'?
A: This is a mistake in the labelling of this input node. A reference genome should be provided.

Q: Are you required to configure the 'SRR read data' node in the wf_genmap_multi and wf_trmap_multi workflows?
A: For these workflows the input node 'SRR read data' does not need to be configured. When running the workflow in batch mode, the selected input
	files will enter the workflow via the 'SRR read data' input node.
